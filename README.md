# Custom Printf Implementation

This project implements a custom printf function in C, providing functionality similar to the standard printf function available in the C standard library.

## Description

The `main.h` file contains the declarations of functions and structures necessary for the implementation of the custom printf function.

The `handle_specifier.c` file implements the function responsible for handling format specifiers and invoking corresponding printer functions.

The `my_char_printer.c` file implements the function to print a single character.

The `my_int_printer.c` file implements the function to print integers.

The `my_string_printer.c` file implements the function to print strings.

The `my_reverse_string_printer.c` file implements the function to print strings in reverse.

The `main.c` file is a file with test cases.

The `_putchar.c` file implements the function to write a character to the standard output.
